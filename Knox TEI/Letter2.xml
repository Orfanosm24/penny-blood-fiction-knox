                    <opener> My Dear Sir, </opener>
                    <p> Agreeably to your wishes, I herewith send you a brief account of my
                        dissection of the lacteal system<ref target="#n11"/> in the seal, and have
                        prefixed to it a short history of the circumstances which led to the
                        inquiry. Many, perhaps, may be inclined to think, that the error which those
                        great anatomists, Tiedemann<ref target="n12"/> and Fohmann<ref target="n13"
                        />, have fallen into, relative to the anatomical distribution of the lacteal
                        vessels, and consequently the formation of the thoracic duct, might have
                        been foreseen a priori; but the authority of these anatomists, and more
                        particularly of Tiedemann, is such, that many naturalists and physiologists
                        would have demanded a direct demonstration, and the question might thus have
                        remained for some time problematical. The preparation I had the honour to
                        show you lately, seems to me to decide the question for ever, and to leave
                        no doubt whatever as to the incorrectness of the opinion of Tiedemann.<ref
                            target="n14"/></p>

                    <p>As I received from you, who are so well acquainted with German literature,
                        the first hint on the subject, and indeed, as the inquiry was suggested by
                        yourself, I beg of you to accept of the following observations,&#8212;and to

                    <p> Previous to certain dissections by Professor Tiedemann and Dr Fohmann, no
                        one had doubted that the absorbent vessels conveying the chyle from the
                        small intestines, and generally called lacteals, proceeded, in the seal as
                        in other animals, to the mesenteric glands, into which they penetrated, and
                        in which they terminated ; from which glance certain other vessels, in
                        structure quite analogous to those just described, arose, which vessels
                        terminated in one or other of the branches of the thoracic duct,
                        contributing very materially towards the formation of the duct, and of the
                            <hi rend="italic"> receptaculum</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">cisterna
                            chyli</hi>, placed usually at the commencement of the duct, and just
                        where it passes through the diaphragm. The first set of vessels, those
                        conveying the chylous fluid from the intestines to the mesenteric glands,
                        anatomists have agreed to call <hi rend="italic">vasa afferentia</hi> ;
                        whilst the second series, or those carrying the chylous fluid (whether the
                        same or altered) from the glands into the thoracic duct, have generally been
                        called <hi rend="italic">vasa efferentia</hi>. The existence of these latter
                        vessels in the seal has been denied by Tiedemann, who states, that the
                        chyle, poured into the glands by the <hi rend="italic">vasa afferentia</hi>,
                        is absorbed by veins only, arising from these glands, and thus conveyed
                        directly into the blood, without passing along the thoracic duct. It would
                        follow, were this account of the anatomy of these vessels correct, that the
                        thoracic duct in these animals was intended for carrying the lymphatic fluid
                        only, and that the chyle passed into the general circulation by quite
                        another route ,-- but, nothing can be imagined more incorrect than such a
                        statement. In the specimen of the common seal (Phoca Vitul. Linn., Seehund
                        of the Germans), which is now lying before me, and from which this
                        description is taken, I find the lacteal vessels proceeding from the small
                        intestines to be very numerous, distinct, and injected with chyle; <ref
                            target="#n01">*</ref>
                        <!-- There's an original footnote with this asterisk --> the greater number
                        of them proceed towards a large mesenteric glad, about four inches in
                        length, placed close to the spine, immediately behind the turn at the
                        duodenum, and not far from the pancreas; the remainder of the lacteals pass
                        into two smaller mesenteric glands, situated close to the former, but
                        somewhat lower down. Into these glands the lacteals penetrate, dividing very
                        generally into several branches before dipping into the gland. Near to the
                        lower or smaller end of the largest mesenteric gland, are seen several
                        branches of lacteal vessels (in the present specimen also loaded with
                        chyle), arising from the gland, and speedily uniting into a larger trunk.
                        This, in its course upwards towards the larger or diaphragmatic end of the
                        gland, is speedily joined by many others from every portion of the gland;
                        these united, form a large trunk, lodged in a fissure which divides the
                        gland as it were into two, longitudinally. By the time the duct has reached
                        the larger extremity of the gland, it is very considerable magnitude,
                        exceeding considerably a crow’s quill, and possessing a valvular structure.
                        After quitting the gland, it crosses over towards the right side, and mainly
                        contributes to form the receptaculum chyli, constituting indeed one of its
                        largest branches.<ref target="#n02">&#8224;</ref>
                        <!-- Using the #n00 here will not break it, would simply point to same note. Cannot do that at the bottom, because every XML ID must be unique-->
                        <!-- There's an original footnote with this obelisk -->
                    </p>
                    <p> The <hi rend="italic">receptaculum chyli</hi> in the seal is very large ; it
                        is situated close to the aortic passage of the diaphragm, and may be said to
                        be formed chiefly by two large branches. One of these, the lacteal branch,
                        (the real <hi rend="italic">vas efferens</hi> of the mesenteric glands), has
                        been already described ; the other is situated more towards the right side,
                        proceeding from the loins and the lower extremities. I traced it readily to
                        the pelvis. Several other branches, but somewhat less in calibre, join the
                            <hi rend="italic">receptaculum</hi> from the side of the stomach and
                        chest. The thoracic duct is large and regular; it joins the general venous
                        circulation as usual, by entering the veins near the junction of the jugular
                        and subclavian of the left side. The fluid contained in the thoracic duct
                        was much thinner and less opaque than the chyle, which filled as well the
                            <hi rend="italic">vasa afferentia</hi> as the <hi rend="italic">vasa
                            efferentia</hi>. </p>
                    <p> The dissection was one of the easiest I have ever attempted; nor can I
                        account for the extraordinary oversight of Professor Tiedemann in any other
                        way than by supposing his specimens to have been greatly mutilated, and
                        totally unfit for dissection.<ref target="#n15"/> The parts have been
                        prepared for demonstration, though, from the great facility with which the
                        true anatomy was made out, I scarcely deem them of that importance which
                        otherwise would have belonged to them, had they, instead of merely
                        correcting an error, established any new fact in anatomical and
                        physiological science.<ref target="#n16"/>

                    <p> In a letter which I had the honour to submit to you on the anatomy of the
                        chyliferous system of vessels in the seal, (<hi rend="italic">Phoca
                            Vitulina, Linn.</hi>), I endeavoured to show, that whatever support the
                        modern doctrine of “absorption by means of veins”<ref target="#n17"/> might
                        have derived from the supposed discoveries of Professor Tiedemann and others
                        relative to the distribution of the lacteal system in the seal, such support
                        must, for the future, be denied these doctrines, for the reason, that a
                        dissection, performed as you have seen, before numerous competent judges of
                        such matters, and under the most favourable circumstances, entirely
                        disproved the discoveries of the distinguished German anatomist, and set the
                        question, as I think was likewise your opinion, at rest for ever.<ref
                            target="#n18"/>
                    </p>

                    <p> Permit me briefly to mention to you certain details which ought perhaps to
                        have been introduced into my former letter, but which the comparative
                        facility of the dissection, with such as, in the course of my comparative
                        anatomy studies, I have been accustomed to perform, induced me to withhold. </p>
                    <p> The seal I examined had been very recently taken in a net by the fishermen
                        in the immediate neighbourhood, so that it came into my hands in the
                        freshest condition.<ref target="#n19"/> The lacteal vessels of the animal,
                        as far as the mesenteric glands, that is, the vessels usually called <hi
                            rend="italic">vasa afferentia</hi>, were filled with the chyle, the
                        fluid naturally belonging to them. The great <hi rend="italic">vas
                            efferens</hi>, into which poured numerous smaller ones, congregating as
                        it were from every portion of the gland, was also filled with chyle; it
                        entered, by a very large trunk, the <hi rend="italic">receptaculum
                            chyli</hi>, which in the specimen I examined was comparatively large;
                        nor had the chyle in the least altered its sensible qualities till after it
                        became mixed with the thinner lymph, brought into the <hi rend="italic"
                            >receptaculum</hi>, by several other great branches of lymphatic vessels
                        which entered it, coming from the posterior extremities, loins, back,
                        &#38;c., and which have been already described. </p>
                    <p> Hitherto it might be said, that the knife had scarcely been used, and in
                        this perfect and natural state, the dissection was shown to you.<ref
                            target="#n20"/> Previous to putting up the parts in spirits as an
                        anatomical specimen<ref target="#n21"/>, I filled the lacteals proceeding
                        from the intestine (which, for brevity’s sake, I shall hereafter call the
                            <hi rend="italic">vasa afferentia</hi>) with quicksilver<ref
                            target="#n22"/>; the metal penetrated the largest of the mesenteric
                        glands, and seemed to reappear in the <hi rend="italic">vas efferens</hi> in
                        its way to join the thoracic duct, but this I afterwards found not to be the
                            case.<ref target="#n23"/> I beg of you to remark here, that there were
                        filled with quicksilver in the seal about twenty lacteals, <hi rend="italic"
                            >and lacteals only</hi>, for I injected those vessels alone which
                        contained chyle. I recommend this caution strongly to the attention of those
                        engaged in such inquiries.<ref target="#n24"/> It has appeared to me, that
                        after a time the lacteals empty themselves of their natural fluids, and in
                        this state the minute branches of the mesenteric veins bear a considerable
                        resemblance to them. It was not thought prudent to push these injections too
                        far, lest the vessels should rupture, and the preparation (which is to be
                        placed in the Anatomical Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons) be
                        destroyed. Finally, previous to placing the preparation in spirits, the <hi
                            rend="italic">vas efferens</hi> was opened, and, on gently blowing air
                        into it, the thoracic duct was immediately filled as high as its passage
                        into the veins. </p>
                    <p> I conclude then, that, if ever quicksilver found its way into the mesenteric
                        veins of the seal, on being simply injected into the lacteals proceeding
                        from the intestine to the mesenteric glands, that such an appearance by no
                        means marks the usual route of the chyle into the general circulation ; for
                        we have shown, 1st, that there exists at least one large <hi rend="italic"
                            >vas efferens</hi>, of a calibre amply sufficient to convey the whole of
                        the chyle into the thoracic duct; 2d
                        <!-- check the original document here -->, that this vessel, into which are
                        poured innumerable smaller branches from every part of the mesenteric
                        glands, is, in the healthy and fresh specimen, filled with a fluid
                        resembling chyle in all respects; 3d that although quicksilver did not, at
                        least satisfactorily, pass into this vessel by being injected into the <hi
                            rend="italic">vasa afferentia</hi>, we have no reason to think that it
                        may not do so in the very next specimen examined. Moreover, the <hi
                            rend="italic">vas efferens</hi> was filled with its own fluid the chyle,
                        which I imagine to be much more satisfactory than if filled with
                        quicksilver; and finally, as we shall see in the next letter, how trifling a
                        pressure will stop the progress of quicksilver through any vessel, no
                        important inference can be drawn from its appearance or non-appearance in
                        the thoracic duct, unless supported by more direct testimony, drawn from the
                        true anatomy of the part. I might add, that I have great doubts whether the
                            <hi rend="italic">vasa efferentia</hi> in man can be injected by pouring
                        quicksilver into the <hi rend="italic">vasa afferentia</hi>. Who would
                        venture to call their existence into question? Yet we have no other proofs
                        of their presence than what I have offered in the seal, viz. their
                        demonstration by dissection ; their direct continuity with the thoracic duct
                        ; the origin of their roots in the mesenteric glands ; lastly, <hi

                    <p> But there is a class of animals in which the phenomena attending the passage
                        of the chyle into the mass of blood, differ in several respects from what
                        occurs in man and in other mammiferous animals ; and it has been suggested
                        to me, that perhaps Professor Tiedemann’s views might have been directed
                        chiefly to the class of animals I now speak of, viz. the cetaceous mammalia. </p>
                    <p> As early as 1795, my much respected preceptor, Mr John Abernethy<ref
                            target="#n25"/>, demonstrated, that in the whale (the specimen was a
                        male of the <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> balæna) there are two ways by which
                        the chyle can pass from the intestines into the thoracic duct ; “one of
                        these is through those lacteals which pour the absorbent chyle into bags
                        (mesenteric glands), in which it receives an addition of animal fluids. The
                        other passage for the chyle is through those lacteals which form a plexus on
                        the inside of the bags ; through these vessels it passes with some
                        difficulty, on account of their communications with each other ; and it is
                        conveyed by them to the thoracic duct, in the same state that it was when
                        first imbibed from the intestines. ” <ref target="#n04">*</ref>
                        <!-- Another original footnote here -->
                    </p>
                    <p> The peculiarities in the anatomy of the lactiferous vessels of the whale, as
                        discovered and first described by Mr Abernethy, are important. There are <hi
                            rend="italic">vasa afferentia</hi> which are continuous with the <hi
                            rend="italic">vasa efferentia</hi>, and with the thoracic duct. <ref
                            target="#n05">&#8224;</ref>
                        <!-- Another original footnote here --> But as the lacteals open into the
                        interior of the mesenteric glands (which are in this animal hollow
                        internally) by sufficiently wide orifices, and pour the chyle into a central
                        cavity, into which also enter numerous veins and arteries, also by large and
                        distinct orifices; it must be evident, that when quicksilver is poured in
                        sufficient quantity into these cavities through the <hi rend="italic">vasa
                            afferentia</hi>, it will more readily find its way into the general
                        venous system than into the thoracic duct, by reason of the smaller size of
                        the respective vessels. But though this happens to quicksilver in the dead
                        body, every physiologist knows, that a precisely inverse law may take place
                        in the living ; and it is sufficiently remarkable, that in the Memoir of Mr
                        Abernethy on the Anatomy of the Whale<ref target="#n26"/>, that eminent
                        physiologist, though he found numerous orifices of veins entering into the
                        central cavities of the mesenteric glands in that class of animals, does not
                        therefore infer that the chyle passes into these veins ; on the contrary, he
                        infers that there are <hi rend="italic">vasa efferentia</hi> which absorb
                        the chyle so poured out ; but it is matter of regret, that the existence of
                        such vessels was not proved by him. </p>
                    <p> I became very anxious to ascertain if such an anatomy of the mesenteric
                        glands and lacteals as had been discovered by Mr Abernethy, existed also in
                        the common dolphin or porpuss<ref target="#n27"/> ; for I had been assured
                        by a friend, that he had seen a specimen in which the quicksilver, injected
                        into the <hi rend="italic">vasa inferentia</hi>, passed readily into the
                        mesenteric veins, and so into the general circulation. In the first specimen
                        I examined, I observed that quicksilver did pass from the mesenteric glands
                        into the <hi rend="italic">vena portæ</hi>, by means of a small vein, though
                        not in any great quantity. But this did not happen until the animal had lain
                        nearly three days on the dissecting table, in very sultry weather, and until
                        I had injected rather more than sixty lacteals. </p>
                    <!-- Unsure if I need unicode for the ae combined vowel symbol -->
                    <p> By this time the chyle had disappeared from numerous vessels, and in many
                        instances they were not easily detected. In the second specimen of this
                        animal, dissected lately by me, though more than eighty large lacteals
                        proceeding from the intestines, to the mesenteric gland, were filled with
                        quicksilver, not a globule could be detected, either in the veins or in any
                        vessel or <hi rend="italic">vas efferens</hi>, which could be traced to the
                        thoracic duct. <ref target="#n06">*</ref>
                        <!-- Another original footnote here --> The reason of this I imagine to be,
                        that the radicles of the <hi rend="italic">vasa efferentia</hi> are very
                        small, and that these vessels do not collect into one or two large branches,
                        in the manner of most other animals, but proceed directly to the next plexus
                        of absorbents, which in the dolphin supply the place of the <hi
                            rend="italic">receptaculum chyli</hi>. With all my efforts, and after
                        the most careful dissection, I could only trace distinctly two other <hi
                            rend="italic">vasa efferentia</hi>, proceeding directly from one of the
                        mesenteric glands, into a branch continuous with the thoracic ducts.
                        Moreover it is to be observed, that the mesenteric glands in the
                            porpoise<ref target="#n28"/> are remarkably firm. I cut open several of
                        them, and found the injected quicksilver uniformly contained in their proper
                        vessels, whose very thin tunics formed a striking contrast with the
                        surrounding firm substance, of which the gland is chiefly composed. </p>
                    <p> Without meaning to deny that there are certain grounds for supposing, that
                        in certain animals, the chyle may follow a different route in its way to the
                        general circulation, I may, in the mean time affirm, that we cannot infer,
                        from the passage of quicksilver into the veins of dead animals, after
                        traversing the <hi rend="italic">vasa inferentia</hi> and mesenteric glands,
                        that the chyle in living vessels adopts the same route to reach the general
                        mass of the blood.<ref target="#n07">&#8224;</ref>

                    <p> In my last letter to you, I briefly recounted the circumstances which led me
                        to inquire into the anatomical distribution of the lacteals in cetaceous
                        animals ; and I detailed the results (somewhat unsatisfactory) of two
                        extremely laborious dissections. In neither of these had I seen the <hi
                            rend="italic">vasa efferentia chylifera</hi> ; and being at the same
                        time aware, that their existence, so far as I know, had been merely presumed
                        by preceding anatomists, but had not been distinctly demonstrated, I felt
                        disposed to think that there might be something in the anatomy of these
                        animals, not very well understood. Some of the arguments for and against the
                        doctrine of absorption of the chyle by veins I have stated in the letter
                        immediately preceding this. </p>
                    <p> The result of the inquiry into the lacteals of the porpoise being thus by no
                        means satisfactory to me, I availed myself of the first opportunity again of
                        resuming it, and of conducting the dissection, and injection of the
                        lacteals, somewhat differently. Having therefore obtained a third specimen
                        of the porpoise, <ref target="#n08">*</ref>
                        <!-- Another original footnote here --> my first care was to inject with
                        quicksilver a considerable number of the lacteals high on the mesentery, and
                        nearest to the commencement of the thoracic duct; the whole mass of the
                        intestines was laid over to the left side, and that no impediment might be
                        offered to the course of the quicksilver, a circumstance I neglected in my
                        former dissections, I carefully dissected off the portion of the lower cava
                        and aorta, which lay immediately over the commencing roots of the thoracic
                        duct. At this stage of the dissection, I observed numerous vessels filled
                        with chyle proceeding from the direction of the mesenteric glands towards
                        the thoracic duct, and terminating in it ; I felt convinced that these
                        vessels were the true <hi rend="italic">vasa efferentia</hi>, but unwilling
                        to rest a fact of so much importance on the bare inspection of vessels, at
                        all times deceptive in their appearance, I proceeded to fill about a dozen
                        of the lacteals (the <hi rend="italic">afferentia</hi>) with quicksilver,
                        after traversing the glands, flowed along the <hi rend="italic">vasa
                            efferentia</hi>, mixed with the chyle, and passed directly into the
                        thoracic duct. The number of the <hi rend="italic">vasa efferentia</hi> so
                        filled, might be about six, and the quantity of quicksilver conveyed by them
                        into the thoracic duct was such as to endanger its rupture. I next distended
                        the thoracic duct with air, and traced it to its entrance into the veins;
                        the valves of this vessel were as numerous as I have ever seen them, and the
                        tunics of the duct were stronger than I expected them to be. </p>
                    <p> I ought further to mention, that the column of quicksilver used was not more
                        than nine or ten inches in depth ; yet such was the facility with which the
                        metal traversed the glands, and penetrated to the thoracic duct, that in
                        order to secure the preparation, and retain the fluid metal in the <hi
                            rend="italic">vasa afferentia</hi>, I was obliged to place a tight
                        ligature immediately outside these glands; previous to doing this, the
                        vessels (the <hi rend="italic">vasa afferentia</hi>) had been twice filled
                        with quicksilver, which had as often disappeared. So many of the <hi
                            rend="italic">efferentia</hi> (which are very numerous) had been cut,
                        that I found it impracticable to arrange the preparation in any other way.
                        Moreover, I have no doubt that similar results may at all times be commanded
                        by a little care and patience on the part of the dissector, and by attention
                        to those circumstances which rendered my first dissections unsatisfactory. </p>
                    <p> We cannot, I presume, now hesitate in affirming, that the anatomy of the
                        seal and of the porpoise do not furnish any argument against the long
                        established doctrine of the transmission of the chyle, the nutrient fluid of
                        the body, to the general mass of blood, by a peculiar system of vessels,
                        consisting of one set of vessels which convey the chyle to the mesenteric
                        glands; and of another set of a precisely similar structure, only somewhat
                        larger, conveying the chyle more or less altered from the glands to the
                        thoracic duct, and thence into the veins; and it seems proved that there is
                        no other route by which the chyle passes into the blood, or at least that no
                        necessity arising out of peculiarity in structure has yet been shown in any
                        animal, for its adopting a different course. The facility with which the
                        metal reached the <hi rend="italic">vasa efferentia</hi>, makes it probable
                        that a structure similar to what exists in the whale, as described by Mr
                        Abernethy, will also be found in the porpoise ; that is, that certain
                        lacteals pass directly through the glands, maintaining a comparatively large
                        calibre throughout ; but I mention this merely as a conjecture. It will
                        afford me much pleasure, should the result of this inquiry meet with your
                        approbation. </p>

            <note type="editorial" xml:id="n11">The lacteal system essentially refers to what is now
                understood as the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system “consists of an extensive
                network of vessels deputed to the drainage of extravasated fluids. The contractility
                of lymphatic vessels and the presence of valves are essential for the generation and
                regulation of the lymph transport.” In simpler terms, the lymphatic system is more
                or less an essential part of the immune system. It is in need of much further study,
                especially with regard to clinical oncology. Prior to modern definitions, the
                lymphatic system was called by the name “lacteal” because of its easily identifiable
                “milk-like content”, which refers to chyle. The 17th century was considered the
                golden age of research into the lymphatic system in the Western world (Natale et al.
                417).</note>
            <note type="editorial" xml:id="n12">Here, Knox is referring to a famous German anatomist
                (received his M.D.) known for his landmark contributions to a variety of fields:
                zoology, embryology, morphology, and many more. He was especially known for his
                comprehensive work on fetal brain development, and his inarguable evidence proving
                that a fetus has a closed circulatory system separate from the mother’s ("Tiedemann,
                Friedrich"). </note>
            <note type="editorial" xml:id="n13">The person referred to here is likely Vincenz
                Fohmann, another German anatomist most known for his masterful injections of mercury
                into the smallest lymphatic vessels, preserved to this day in museums of Heidelberg
                and Liège (Natale et al. 425-6).</note>
            <note type="editorial" xml:id="n14">Knox will go on to specify that the fatal error he
                has perceived in Tiedemann’s conceptualization and/or dissection of the lymphatic
                system is “absorption by means of veins.” My understanding is that he aims to
                complicate this perception by way of proving absorption via blood vessels rather
                than veins. Tiedemann had long been known for his interest in “the absorption of
                nutrients from the alimentary tract” in relation to lymphatic vessels by 1820, and
                it would later inform his work on the spleen. (At the time, little was known about
                the function and/or importance of the spleen, and its integration into the lymphatic
                system in the process of blood formation--so this was a sign of enormous progress).
                So in truth it seems that Knox either may be under a misapprehension, or is pointing
                out some small adjustment in the processes outlined by Tiedemann. ("Tiedemann,
                Friedrich"). </note>
            <note type="editorial" xml:id="n15">This is unfortunately not the first case (nor the
                last) in which Knox would denigrate the work of his fellow colleagues with immediate
                and unabating fervor, insisting on the superiority of his own work by comparison.
                Biographical evidence confirms this propensity, in that an American naturalist named
                John James Audubon visited Edinburgh in 1826 and was welcomed with unerring
                consideration and support from Knox. However, the moment Audubon asked his fellow
                scientists to evaluate the work he’d done, Knox (along with his colleagues) became
                acerbic and harsh, degrading everything he’d accomplished all of a sudden. Audubon
                would note his mixed feelings and disappointment about the encounter in his own
                writings (Rosner 95-6).</note>
            <note type="editorial" xml:id="n16">This is an ambitious statement, and in all
                likelihood untrue. William Hunter won the Copley medal in 1769 for his astounding
                strides in knowledge of the lymphatic system. He observed, much like Knox, that
                “lymphatics and lacteals were two different features contributing to the formation
                of the same network of vessels endowed with absorbent function. He noted that a dye
                injected into the arteries fills the veins but never enters the lymphatic vessels,
                unless the arterial wall is damaged…unlike veins, lymphatics are not continuous with
                arteries” (Natale et al. 423). Although their approaches were different, both
                understood the movement of lymphatic fluid via capillaries. If there is any
                observation of distinction here, it is likely more minute than he makes it out to
                be.</note>
            <note type="editorial" xml:id="n17">This will become evident towards the end of this
                letter-turned-journal article, but essentially Knox here is speaking to the
                discovery of blood vessels and how they transmit human blood throughout the body,
                rather than veins. The smallest kind of blood vessels in the human body are known as
                capillaries, which vitally connect arteries to veins. In the lymphatic system
                specifically, “lymphatic capillaries tend to be larger in diameter than blood
                capillaries and are interspersed among them to enhance their ability to collect
                interstitial fluid efficiently. They are critical in the drainage of extracellular
                fluid and allow this fluid to enter the closed capillaries but not exit due to their
                unique morphology. Special lymphatic capillaries called lacteals exist in the small
                intestine to contribute to the absorption of dietary fats” (Null et al.). While it
                is unclear if Knox’s discovery was truly as groundbreaking as he proclaims it to be
                (capillaries were discovered long before 1824 in 1661 by Marcello Malpighi
                (Pearce)), there was at least basic merit to sharing this observation with the
                larger scientific community (Natale et al. 418). More microscopic aspects of
                medicine were still in the process of being discovered and described in detail at
                the time, and this process is continuing with regard to the lymphatic system even
                now.</note>
            <note type="editorial" xml:id="n18">There is something to be said here for Knox’s
                insistence upon proving Tiedemann wrong, rather than establishing a new discovery
                and writing in dialogue with other anatomists, which appears to be more common
                practice. The rhetoric and focal point of his argument (toward only his own merit)
                suggests the kind of myopia that would fuel his denial of any negligence in the
                Burke and Hare murder trials. Furthermore, there is the reality that his work is
                built on much of existing anatomical expertise, a footnote in a much larger
                accomplishment.</note>
            <note type="editorial" xml:id="n19">Burke said in his official confession that “Knox was
                present on two occasions when Burke and Hare delivered murdered bodies, and that in
                one case he had approved of a corpse’s freshness, but asked no questions”
                (Richardson 135). While one can understand the necessity of keeping organic material
                intact for the sake of an unmarred dissection, the implications of two men bringing
                him a “freshly” deceased body with consistent immediacy should have been an obvious
                indication that something was amiss based solely on temporal logistics. Christison
                aptly observed as much in his recollection of Knox’s boasts about receiving a dozen
                or so bodies in such pristine condition, with the incriminating revelation that
                “[Knox] had made very light of this suggestion” when Christison remarked that the
                corpses likely had never been buried (and then stolen) at all based on their
                condition (Richardson 141).</note>
            <note type="editorial" xml:id="n20">Again, he obsesses over the quality of his
                dissection tools with perhaps more frequency than would be deemed appropriate or
                necessary; certainly the tools at hand do have some bearing on the quality of one’s
                work, but this is common knowledge and common practice. </note>
            <note type="editorial" xml:id="n21">Formerly mentioned in my explanatory essay above,
                this practice of preserving organic material “in spirits” (usually meant alcohol)
                was not limited to mere animal specimens. Mary Paterson’s body was subjected to the
                same preservation, but with a much more perverse intent. Here one can see the
                beginnings of where Knox’s ardor likely extended too far; what was once for strictly
                scientific purposes merged into the realm of misogynistic objectification. While
                anatomists and doctors may not all engage in this confusion of priority or intent,
                it is clear that the working class had ample reason to suspect the intentions of
                certain anatomists and doctors. No one person is immune to such biases or
                misconduct.</note>
            <note type="editorial" xml:id="n22">Quicksilver is liquid mercury, often used in a
                variety of scientific endeavors. Naturally as a result of the toxicity of mercury
                vaporization at room temperature, this substance is no longer commonly used in this
                kind of research, and when it is, the utmost precautions are taken. The silver
                substance was used in anatomical experiments in order to reveal the movement of
                certain body fluids throughout the body, as the silver coloring and permeation was
                easily visible to the naked eye.</note>
            <note type="editorial" xml:id="n23">Part of why liquid mercury was so effective in
                tracing the lymphatic system in particular is the fact that “lymphatic vessels…form
                a largely invisible, delicate and intricate network…[it seemed] more indefinite,
                elusive and mysterious” (Natale et al. 418). While lacteals have a white liquid
                (chyle) inside that render them more visible in the body, lymphatic vessels
                elsewhere “contain[ed] a clear water fluid that render[ed] them nearby invisible and
                their presence was very difficult to be documented” (Natale et al. 423).</note>
            <note type="editorial" xml:id="n24"> To Knox’s credit, part of why anatomical
                investigations into the lymphatic system were so few was due to the exceptional
                technical difficulty of such procedures necessitating liquid mercury injections for
                a meaningful dissection. British surgeon John Sheldon explained in 1784 that “the
                difficulty of dissection is increased, from the necessity of injecting with
                quicksilver: for if we happen to wound the vessels, our labor will be lost by the
                escape of that subtile fluid” (Natale et al. 423).</note>
            <note type="editorial" xml:id="n25">John Abernethy was a well-known surgeon from this
                period, born in London and primarily working at St. Bartholomew’s hospital. He was
                best known for his skill as an anatomy instructor; he was so sought after that the
                hospital eventually had to build a lecture theater to accommodate the endless stream
                of his incoming students (Jacyna). Both Knox and Christison studied under him, which
                may explain the uncharacteristic deference with which Knox refers to
                Abernethy.</note>
            <note type="editorial" xml:id="n26">I was unable to find any larger works (e.g. a book)
                with this same title. The closest match I could find was a journal article titled
                “Some Particulars in the Anatomy of a Whale” from the Philosophical Transactions of
                the Royal Society of London in 1796. Knox’s description also aligns with the
                contents of this article, suggesting the veracity of this identification (Home and
                Abernethy 27-9).</note>
