                <opener> To the Editor of the ‘Caledonian Mercury.'<ref target="#n01"/> </opener>
                <p>Sir,&#8212;I regret troubling either you or the public with anything personal,
                    but I cannot be insensible of the feelings of my friends, or of the character of
                    the profession to which I have the honour of belonging. Had I alone been
                    concerned, I should never have thought of obtruding on the public by this
                    communication.</p>
                <p>I have a class of above 400 pupils.<ref target="#n02"/> No person can be at the head of such an
                    establishment without necessarily running the risk of being imposed upon by
                    those who furnish the material of their science to anatomical teachers ; and,
                    accordingly, there is hardly any such person who has not occasionally incurred
                    odium or suspicion from his supposed accession to those violations of the law,
                    without which anatomy can scarcely now be practised.<ref target="#n03"/> That I should have become
                    an object of popular prejudice, therefore, since mine happened to be the
                    establishment with which Burke and Hare chiefly dealt, was nothing more than
                    what I had to expect. But if means had not been purposely taken, and most keenly
                    persevered in, to misrepresent facts and to inflame the public mind, that
                    prejudice would at least have stood on right ground, and would ultimately have
                    passed away<ref target="#n04"/>, by its being seen that I had been exposed to a mere misfortune
                    which would almost certainly have occurred to anybody else who had been in my
                    situation.<ref target="#n05"/> </p>
                <p> But every effort has been employed to convert my misfortune into positive and
                    intended personal guilt of the most dreadful character. Scarcely any individual
                    has ever been the object of more systematic or atrocious attacks than I have
                    been. Nobody acquainted with this place requires to be told from what quarter
                    these have proceeded.<ref target="#n06"/></p>
                <p> I allowed them to go on for months without taking the slightest notice of them<ref target="#n07"/> ;
                    and I was inclined to adhere to this system, especially as the public
                    authorities by never charging me with any offence, gave the only attestation
                    they could that they had nothing to charge me with. But my friends interfered
                    for me. <hi rend="italic">Without consulting me,</hi> they directed an agent to
                    institute the most rigid and unsparing examination into the facts. I was totally
                    unacquainted with this gentleman ; but I understood that in naming Mr. Ellis
                    they named a person whose character is a sufficient pledge for the propriety of
                    his proceedings.</p>
                <p> The result of his inquiries was laid before the Dean of Faculty and another
                    Counsel, who were asked what ought to be done. These gentlemen gave it as their
                    opinion that the evidence was completely satisfactory, and that there was no
                    want of actionable matter, but that there was one ground on which it was my duty
                    to resist the temptation of going into a court of law. This was, that the
                    disclosures of the most innocent proceedings even of the best-conducted
                    dissecting-room must always shock the public and be hurtful to science. But they
                    recommended that a few persons of undoubted weight and character should be asked
                    to investigate the matter, in order that, if I deserved it, an attestation might
                    be given to me which would be more satisfactory to my friends than any mere
                    statements of mine could be expected to be. This led to the formation of a
                    Committee, which was never meant by me to be anything but private. But the fact
                    of its sitting soon got into the newspapers, and hence the necessity under which
                    I am placed of explaining how that proceeding, in which the public has been made
                    to take an interest, has terminated.</p>
                <p> I have been on habits of friendship with some of the Committee ; with others of
                    them I have been acquainted ; and some of them I don’t even yet know by sight. I
                    took no charge whatever of their proceedings. In order that there might be no
                    pretence for saying that truth was obstructed from fear, I gave a written
                    protection to every person to say what he chose about or against me. The extent
                    to which this was in some instances taken advantage of will probably not be soon
                    forgotten by those who witnessed it.</p>
                <p> After a severe and laborious investigation of about six weeks, the result is
                    contained in the following report, which was put into my hands last night. It is
                    signed by every member of the Committee except one, who ceased to act long
                    before the evidence was completed.</p>
                <p> I cannot be supposed to be a candid judge of my own case<ref target="#n08"/>, and therefore it is
                    extremely probable that any opinion of mine on the last view adopted by the
                    Committee is incorrect, and theirs right. If it be so, I most willingly submit
                    to the censure they have inflicted, and shall hold it my duty to profit from it
                    by due care hereafter. My consolation is, that I have at least not been
                    obstinate in my errors,<ref target="#n09"/> and that no sanction has ever been given in any fair
                    quarter to the more serious imputations by which it has been the interest of
                    certain persons to assail me. Candid men will judge of me according to the
                    situation in which I was placed at the time<ref target="#n10"/>, and not according to the wisdom
                    which has unexpectedly been acquired since.</p>
                <p> This is the very first time that I have ever made any statement to the public in
                    my own vindication, and it shall be the last. It would be unjust to the authors
                    of the former calumnies to suppose that they would not renew them now. I can
                    only assure them that, in so far as I am concerned, they will renew them in
                    vain.</p>

            <note type="editorial" xml:id="n01">The Caledonian Mercury was a Scottish newspaper most
                known for its literary criticism with forays into the political, which
                contemporaneously covered the proceedings of the Burke and Hare murder trials as
                they were ongoing in 1828. </note>
            <note type="editorial" xml:id="n02">Several sources corroborate the sheer numbers if not
                the admiration Knox received from his students as a capable anatomy instructor, not
                the least of which includes Henry Lonsdale--who collected and published Knox’s
                writings in an attempt to exonerate his teacher. While Lonsdale’s attempt is a
                well-meaning one, it is poorly contextualized and bereft of nuance at best (Lonsdale
                82-88).</note>
            <note type="editorial" xml:id="n03">There is a certain distinction to be made here, in
                that Knox is both correct and incorrect about what he posits to be true. Many
                surgeons and anatomists alike complained of the nonexistent legal avenues by which
                cadavers could be procured for dissection; there were hospitals and hanged men, but
                the numbers simply were not enough to supply training materials for all aspiring
                medical professionals. However, this did not mean that all doctors/anatomists took
                in corpses without a single thought as to their origins; Christison noted as much
                during the Burke and Hare police investigation when he asked Knox how the most
                recent body delivered by the two men was in such pristine and untouched
                condition--bereft of all the usual signs of acquisition via body snatching
                (Richardson 141).</note>
            <note type="editorial" xml:id="n04"> It is incredibly unlikely that public sentiment
                would have ever pivoted in his favor: “failure of the law to investigate Knox’s role
                in the multiple murders had provoked widespread resentment and disbelief”
                (Richardson 137). The working class had not failed to notice the double standard in
                the current legal system, in which impoverished people were persecuted on the
                smallest infractions--or the fact that Burke and Hare’s victims had all been
                vulnerable poor people as well. </note>
            <note type="editorial" xml:id="n05"> The implication that Knox was a passive party in
                the Burke and Hare murders is genuinely false. He was, in fact, central to the
                outcome of the proceedings. Most know that Hare was able to escape the death
                sentence because he “turned King’s evidence, convicting his confederate [Burke], who
                was hanged and publicly dissected” (Richardson 133). However, this was only possible
                because the prosecution could only offer Hare immunity on the basis of Knox’s
                destruction--and therefore lack--of evidence. “Burke and his wife Nelly stood trial
                for the death of the last victim, Mary Docherty, only” because her remains were
                found and immediately reported to the police. In addition, as indicated several
                times in the explanatory essay above, many people had already caught on to Knox’s
                misconduct, and condemned him outright; to say nothing of the countless enemies he
                made of his colleagues.</note>
            <note type="editorial" xml:id="n06"> Knox was hardly the only target of such criticism;
                public displeasure with body-snatching and the existence of resurrection men was
                commonplace and frequently directed at medical personnel and adjacent professions.
                Much of public outrage stemmed from his clear complicity in this very public and
                egregious case, his general indifference to human life, and the lack of justice in
                the wake of his clear complicity. If anything, his public exoneration was likely a
                significant impetus for what would be a string of riots and vicious attacks on
                doctors as soon as the murder trials ended in 1829 (Dittmer and Raine 114-116).
                Furthermore, this outrage was not consigned to the poor alone; many other doctors
                also disavowed Knox’s crimes (Richardson 137).</note>
            <note type="editorial" xml:id="n07"> In the wake of the illegitimate investigation into
                Knox’s culpability in regards to the Burke and Hare murders, the entirety of
                Edinburgh was in an uproar--not what one might be able to call hardly noticeable.
                There was an effigy gathering, and not only that, they forewent burning the effigy
                explicitly created to look like Knox in favor of symbolically dismembering it in
                front of his house. There can be no doubt the implication inherent in this choice,
                as the public had been clamoring for proper justice--that they wanted him and Hare
                to be “hanged and publicly dissected” just as Burke was (Richardson 133, 138). There
                is also something to be said of his rhetoric here in “I allowed them to go on,”
                conflating a rightfully angry public with a misbehaving child; suggesting Knox’s
                real incapacity or unwillingness to consider the seriousness of what he had
                enabled.</note>
            <note type="editorial" xml:id="n08"> This self-diminishing and harmless tone adds insult
                to injury in the face of his known deeds. Furthermore, the book in which it was
                first published--with the intent to herald Knox’s greatness--was published fifty
                years after the Burke and Hare murder trials had ended in 1870. While it is likely
                many people knew this false presentation of Knox’s innocence for what it was, the
                lack of contextualization does run the risk of younger readers taking in Knox’s
                words based on surface level information. Furthermore, this letter is immediately
                followed by the official documentation of the Committee’s decision to absolve Knox
                of any charges. While there is enough dissonance to suggest more digging is
                necessary to determine what happened, I do think it invites readers to believe in
                Lonsdale’s claims in accordance with general reliance on the trustworthiness of
                court-approved documents. </note>
            <note type="editorial" xml:id="n09"> His refusal to contribute anything to the
                proceedings of the murder trials and earnestly address public discontent suggest
                otherwise. There is no point within the vicissitudes of his dismantled career or
                active disgust from his peers/the public that he admits to being at the very least
                negligent about his responsibilities in vetting acquired corpses, much less any
                acceptance of partial guilt in the murder of innocent people.</note>
            <note type="editorial" xml:id="n10"> Interestingly, removal from the situation over time
                has created a few attempts to redeem Knox, each one on the basis of his importance
                to science. There is Henry Lonsdale’s entire book dedicated to his life and
                writings, in which a persistent rallying to the defense of his teacher runs
                throughout its pages. Additionally, one such author in 2010 attempted to redeem him
                on the basis of his foresight into the process of rapid evolution and related
                anatomical/naturalist insight. That being said, one must notice the refusal to
                engage with the fear and distress his actions--no matter if they were a degree
                removed from murder by his own hands--contributed to the landscape of medical
                immorality. Furthermore, his indirect incitement of the Anatomy Act of 1832 and the
                New Poor Law of 1834 would only antagonize the working class to an explosion of
                fear.</note>
