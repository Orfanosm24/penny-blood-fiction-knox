               <p>Agreeably to your wishes, I herewith send you a brief account of my dissection of

                  to the inquiry. Many, perhaps, may be inclined to think, that the error which those
                  great anatomists, Tiedemann<a class="link_ref" href="n12"></a> and Fohmann<a class="link_ref" href="n13"></a>, have fallen into, relative to the anatomical distribution of the lacteal vessels,
                  and consequently the formation of the thoracic duct, might have been foreseen a priori;
                  but the authority of these anatomists, and more particularly of Tiedemann, is such,
                  that many naturalists and physiologists would have demanded a direct demonstration,
                  and the question might thus have remained for some time problematical. The preparation
                  I had the honour to show you lately, seems to me to decide the question for ever,
                  and to leave no doubt whatever as to the incorrectness of the opinion of Tiedemann.<a class="link_ref" href="n14"></a></p>
               <p>As I received from you, who are so well acquainted with German literature, the first
                  hint on the subject, and indeed, as the inquiry was suggested by yourself, I beg of
                  you to accept of the following observations,—and to believe me always,</p>

               <p>Previous to certain dissections by Professor Tiedemann and Dr Fohmann, no one had
                  doubted that the absorbent vessels conveying the chyle from the small intestines,
                  and generally called lacteals, proceeded, in the seal as in other animals, to the
                  mesenteric glands, into which they penetrated, and in which they terminated ; from
                  which glance certain other vessels, in structure quite analogous to those just described,
                  arose, which vessels terminated in one or other of the branches of the thoracic duct,
                  contributing very materially towards the formation of the duct, and of the <span style="font-style:italic">receptaculum</span>, or <span style="font-style:italic">cisterna chyli</span>, placed usually at the commencement of the duct, and just where it passes through
                  the diaphragm. The first set of vessels, those conveying the chylous fluid from the
                  intestines to the mesenteric glands, anatomists have agreed to call <span style="font-style:italic">vasa afferentia</span> ; whilst the second series, or those carrying the chylous fluid (whether the same
                  or altered) from the glands into the thoracic duct, have generally been called <span style="font-style:italic">vasa efferentia</span>. The existence of these latter vessels in the seal has been denied by Tiedemann,
                  who states, that the chyle, poured into the glands by the <span style="font-style:italic">vasa afferentia</span>, is absorbed by veins only, arising from these glands, and thus conveyed directly
                  into the blood, without passing along the thoracic duct. It would follow, were this
                  account of the anatomy of these vessels correct, that the thoracic duct in these animals
                  was intended for carrying the lymphatic fluid only, and that the chyle passed into
                  the general circulation by quite another route ,-- but, nothing can be imagined more
                  incorrect than such a statement. In the specimen of the common seal (Phoca Vitul.
                  Linn., Seehund of the Germans), which is now lying before me, and from which this
                  description is taken, I find the lacteal vessels proceeding from the small intestines
                  to be very numerous, distinct, and injected with chyle; <a class="link_ref" href="#n01" title="The animal was killed only two days ago.">*</a>  the greater number of them proceed towards a large mesenteric glad, about four inches
                  in length, placed close to the spine, immediately behind the turn at the duodenum,
                  and not far from the pancreas; the remainder of the lacteals pass into two smaller
                  mesenteric glands, situated close to the former, but somewhat lower down. Into these
                  glands the lacteals penetrate, dividing very generally into several branches before
                  dipping into the gland. Near to the lower or smaller end of the largest mesenteric
                  gland, are seen several branches of lacteal vessels (in the present specimen also
                  loaded with chyle), arising from the gland, and speedily uniting into a larger trunk.
                  This, in its course upwards towards the larger or diaphragmatic end of the gland,
                  is speedily joined by many others from every portion of the gland; these united, form
                  a large trunk, lodged in a fissure which divides the gland as it were into two, longitudinally.
                  By the time the duct has reached the larger extremity of the gland, it is very considerable
                  magnitude, exceeding considerably a crow’s quill, and possessing a valvular structure.
                  After quitting the gland, it crosses over towards the right side, and mainly contributes
                  to form the receptaculum chyli, constituting indeed one of its largest branches.<a class="link_ref" href="#n02" title="On laying open this large and important vas afferens which was done throughout a considerable extent it was observed that the v...">†</a>  </p>
               <p>The <span style="font-style:italic">receptaculum chyli</span> in the seal is very large ; it is situated close to the aortic passage of the diaphragm,
                  and may be said to be formed chiefly by two large branches. One of these, the lacteal
                  branch, (the real <span style="font-style:italic">vas efferens</span> of the mesenteric glands), has been already described ; the other is situated more
                  towards the right side, proceeding from the loins and the lower extremities. I traced
                  it readily to the pelvis. Several other branches, but somewhat less in calibre, join
                  the <span style="font-style:italic">receptaculum</span> from the side of the stomach and chest. The thoracic duct is large and regular; it
                  joins the general venous circulation as usual, by entering the veins near the junction
                  of the jugular and subclavian of the left side. The fluid contained in the thoracic
                  duct was much thinner and less opaque than the chyle, which filled as well the <span style="font-style:italic">vasa afferentia</span> as the <span style="font-style:italic">vasa efferentia</span>.</p>
               <p>The dissection was one of the easiest I have ever attempted; nor can I account for
                  the extraordinary oversight of Professor Tiedemann in any other way than by supposing
                  his specimens to have been greatly mutilated, and totally unfit for dissection.<a class="link_ref" href="#n15" title="This is unfortunately not the first case (nor the last) in which Knox would denigrate the work of his fellow colleagues with im..."></a> The parts have been prepared for demonstration, though, from the great facility with
                  which the true anatomy was made out, I scarcely deem them of that importance which
                  otherwise would have belonged to them, had they, instead of merely correcting an error,
                  established any new fact in anatomical and physiological science.<a class="link_ref" href="#n16" title="This is an ambitious statement and in all likelihood untrue. William Hunter won the Copley medal in 1769 for his astounding str..."></a></p>

               <p>In a letter which I had the honour to submit to you on the anatomy of the chyliferous
                  system of vessels in the seal, (<span style="font-style:italic">Phoca Vitulina, Linn.</span>), I endeavoured to show, that whatever support the modern doctrine of “absorption

                  relative to the distribution of the lacteal system in the seal, such support must,
                  for the future, be denied these doctrines, for the reason, that a dissection, performed
                  as you have seen, before numerous competent judges of such matters, and under the
                  most favourable circumstances, entirely disproved the discoveries of the distinguished
                  German anatomist, and set the question, as I think was likewise your opinion, at rest
                  for ever.<a class="link_ref" href="#n18" title="There is something to be said here for Knoxs insistence upon proving Tiedemann wrong rather than establishing a new discovery a..."></a></p>
               <p>Permit me briefly to mention to you certain details which ought perhaps to have been
                  introduced into my former letter, but which the comparative facility of the dissection,
                  with such as, in the course of my comparative anatomy studies, I have been accustomed
                  to perform, induced me to withhold. </p>
               <p>The seal I examined had been very recently taken in a net by the fishermen in the
                  immediate neighbourhood, so that it came into my hands in the freshest condition.<a class="link_ref" href="#n19" title="Burke said in his official confession that Knox was present on two occasions when Burke and Hare delivered murdered bodies and ..."></a> The lacteal vessels of the animal, as far as the mesenteric glands, that is, the
                  vessels usually called <span style="font-style:italic">vasa afferentia</span>, were filled with the chyle, the fluid naturally belonging to them. The great <span style="font-style:italic">vas efferens</span>, into which poured numerous smaller ones, congregating as it were from every portion
                  of the gland, was also filled with chyle; it entered, by a very large trunk, the <span style="font-style:italic">receptaculum chyli</span>, which in the specimen I examined was comparatively large; nor had the chyle in the
                  least altered its sensible qualities till after it became mixed with the thinner lymph,
                  brought into the <span style="font-style:italic">receptaculum</span>, by several other great branches of lymphatic vessels which entered it, coming from
                  the posterior extremities, loins, back, &amp;c., and which have been already described.</p>
               <p>Hitherto it might be said, that the knife had scarcely been used, and in this perfect
                  and natural state, the dissection was shown to you.<a class="link_ref" href="#n20" title="Again he obsesses over the quality of his dissection tools with perhaps more frequency than would be deemed appropriate or nece..."></a> Previous to putting up the parts in spirits as an anatomical specimen<a class="link_ref" href="#n21" title="Formerly mentioned in my explanatory essay above this practice of preserving organic material in spirits (usually meant alcohol..."></a>, I filled the lacteals proceeding from the intestine (which, for brevity’s sake,
                  I shall hereafter call the <span style="font-style:italic">vasa afferentia</span>) with quicksilver<a class="link_ref" href="#n22" title="Quicksilver is liquid mercury often used in a variety of scientific endeavors.

                  about twenty lacteals, <span style="font-style:italic">and lacteals only</span>, for I injected those vessels alone which contained chyle. I recommend this caution
                  strongly to the attention of those engaged in such inquiries.<a class="link_ref" href="#n24" title="To Knoxs credit part of why anatomical investigations into the lymphatic system were so few was due to the exceptional technica..."></a> It has appeared to me, that after a time the lacteals empty themselves of their natural
                  fluids, and in this state the minute branches of the mesenteric veins bear a considerable
                  resemblance to them. It was not thought prudent to push these injections too far,
                  lest the vessels should rupture, and the preparation (which is to be placed in the
                  Anatomical Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons) be destroyed. Finally, previous
                  to placing the preparation in spirits, the <span style="font-style:italic">vas efferens</span> was opened, and, on gently blowing air into it, the thoracic duct was immediately
                  filled as high as its passage into the veins.</p>
               <p>I conclude then, that, if ever quicksilver found its way into the mesenteric veins
                  of the seal, on being simply injected into the lacteals proceeding from the intestine
                  to the mesenteric glands, that such an appearance by no means marks the usual route
                  of the chyle into the general circulation ; for we have shown, 1st, that there exists
                  at least one large <span style="font-style:italic">vas efferens</span>, of a calibre amply sufficient to convey the whole of the chyle into the thoracic
                  duct; 2d , that this vessel, into which are poured innumerable smaller branches from
                  every part of the mesenteric glands, is, in the healthy and fresh specimen, filled
                  with a fluid resembling chyle in all respects; 3d that although quicksilver did not,
                  at least satisfactorily, pass into this vessel by being injected into the <span style="font-style:italic">vasa afferentia</span>, we have no reason to think that it may not do so in the very next specimen examined.
                  Moreover, the <span style="font-style:italic">vas efferens</span> was filled with its own fluid the chyle, which I imagine to be much more satisfactory
                  than if filled with quicksilver; and finally, as we shall see in the next letter,
                  how trifling a pressure will stop the progress of quicksilver through any vessel,
                  no important inference can be drawn from its appearance or non-appearance in the thoracic
                  duct, unless supported by more direct testimony, drawn from the true anatomy of the
                  part. I might add, that I have great doubts whether the <span style="font-style:italic">vasa efferentia</span> in man can be injected by pouring quicksilver into the <span style="font-style:italic">vasa afferentia</span>. Who would venture to call their existence into question? Yet we have no other proofs
                  of their presence than what I have offered in the seal, viz. their demonstration by
                  dissection ; their direct continuity with the thoracic duct ; the origin of their
                  roots in the mesenteric glands ; lastly, <span style="font-style:italic">their injection with chyle.</span> <a class="link_ref" href="#n03" title="I do not expect that physiologists shall set aside the usual arguments in favour of venous absorption  but the presence of a va...">*</a> </p>
               <p>But there is a class of animals in which the phenomena attending the passage of the
                  chyle into the mass of blood, differ in several respects from what occurs in man and
                  in other mammiferous animals ; and it has been suggested to me, that perhaps Professor
                  Tiedemann’s views might have been directed chiefly to the class of animals I now speak
                  of, viz. the cetaceous mammalia. </p>
               <p>As early as 1795, my much respected preceptor, Mr John Abernethy<a class="link_ref" href="#n25" title="John Abernethy was a wellknown surgeon from this period born in London and primarily working at St. Bartholomews hospital. He w..."></a>, demonstrated, that in the whale (the specimen was a male of the <span style="font-style:italic">genus</span> balæna) there are two ways by which the chyle can pass from the intestines into the
                  thoracic duct ; “one of these is through those lacteals which pour the absorbent chyle
                  into bags (mesenteric glands), in which it receives an addition of animal fluids.
                  The other passage for the chyle is through those lacteals which form a plexus on the
                  inside of the bags ; through these vessels it passes with some difficulty, on account
                  of their communications with each other ; and it is conveyed by them to the thoracic
                  duct, in the same state that it was when first imbibed from the intestines. ” <a class="link_ref" href="#n04" title="Phil Trans.">*</a> </p>
               <p>The peculiarities in the anatomy of the lactiferous vessels of the whale, as discovered
                  and first described by Mr Abernethy, are important. There are <span style="font-style:italic">vasa afferentia</span> which are continuous with the <span style="font-style:italic">vasa efferentia</span>, and with the thoracic duct. <a class="link_ref" href="#n05" title="I suppose them continuous with the thoracic duct  but it is to be remarked that they were not traced to that vessel by Mr Abern...">†</a>  But as the lacteals open into the interior of the mesenteric glands (which are in
                  this animal hollow internally) by sufficiently wide orifices, and pour the chyle into
                  a central cavity, into which also enter numerous veins and arteries, also by large
                  and distinct orifices; it must be evident, that when quicksilver is poured in sufficient
                  quantity into these cavities through the <span style="font-style:italic">vasa afferentia</span>, it will more readily find its way into the general venous system than into the thoracic
                  duct, by reason of the smaller size of the respective vessels. But though this happens
                  to quicksilver in the dead body, every physiologist knows, that a precisely inverse
                  law may take place in the living ; and it is sufficiently remarkable, that in the
                  Memoir of Mr Abernethy on the Anatomy of the Whale<a class="link_ref" href="#n26" title="I was unable to find any larger works (e.g. a book) with this same title. The closest match I could find was a journal article ..."></a>, that eminent physiologist, though he found numerous orifices of veins entering into
                  the central cavities of the mesenteric glands in that class of animals, does not therefore
                  infer that the chyle passes into these veins ; on the contrary, he infers that there
                  are <span style="font-style:italic">vasa efferentia</span> which absorb the chyle so poured out ; but it is matter of regret, that the existence
                  of such vessels was not proved by him.</p>
               <p>I became very anxious to ascertain if such an anatomy of the mesenteric glands and
                  lacteals as had been discovered by Mr Abernethy, existed also in the common dolphin
                  or porpuss<a class="link_ref" href="#n27" title="Now obsolete form of the word porpoise not a typo."></a> ; for I had been assured by a friend, that he had seen a specimen in which the quicksilver,
                  injected into the <span style="font-style:italic">vasa inferentia</span>, passed readily into the mesenteric veins, and so into the general circulation. In
                  the first specimen I examined, I observed that quicksilver did pass from the mesenteric
                  glands into the <span style="font-style:italic">vena portæ</span>, by means of a small vein, though not in any great quantity. But this did not happen
                  until the animal had lain nearly three days on the dissecting table, in very sultry
                  weather, and until I had injected rather more than sixty lacteals.</p>
               <p>By this time the chyle had disappeared from numerous vessels, and in many instances
                  they were not easily detected. In the second specimen of this animal, dissected lately
                  by me, though more than eighty large lacteals proceeding from the intestines, to the
                  mesenteric gland, were filled with quicksilver, not a globule could be detected, either
                  in the veins or in any vessel or <span style="font-style:italic">vas efferens</span>, which could be traced to the thoracic duct. <a class="link_ref" href="#n06" title="It is to be remarked here that only these vessels were filled with quicksilver which evidently contained chyle.">*</a>  The reason of this I imagine to be, that the radicles of the <span style="font-style:italic">vasa efferentia</span> are very small, and that these vessels do not collect into one or two large branches,
                  in the manner of most other animals, but proceed directly to the next plexus of absorbents,
                  which in the dolphin supply the place of the <span style="font-style:italic">receptaculum chyli</span>. With all my efforts, and after the most careful dissection, I could only trace distinctly
                  two other <span style="font-style:italic">vasa efferentia</span>, proceeding directly from one of the mesenteric glands, into a branch continuous
                  with the thoracic ducts. Moreover it is to be observed, that the mesenteric glands
                  in the porpoise<a class="link_ref" href="#n28" title="It is not entirely clear why Knox uses two different forms of this word there does not appear to be a greater purpose."></a> are remarkably firm. I cut open several of them, and found the injected quicksilver
                  uniformly contained in their proper vessels, whose very thin tunics formed a striking
                  contrast with the surrounding firm substance, of which the gland is chiefly composed.</p>
               <p>Without meaning to deny that there are certain grounds for supposing, that in certain
                  animals, the chyle may follow a different route in its way to the general circulation,
                  I may, in the mean time affirm, that we cannot infer, from the passage of quicksilver
                  into the veins of dead animals, after traversing the <span style="font-style:italic">vasa inferentia</span> and mesenteric glands, that the chyle in living vessels adopts the same route to
                  reach the general mass of the blood.<a class="link_ref" href="#n07" title="Mr Abernethy remarks in his admirable Memoir so often quoted that the ready communication of these bags (the mesenteric glands)...">†</a> </p>

               <h2><span class="headingNumber">1.4. </span><span class="head">3. </span></h2>
               <p>In my last letter to you, I briefly recounted the circumstances which led me to inquire
                  into the anatomical distribution of the lacteals in cetaceous animals ; and I detailed
                  the results (somewhat unsatisfactory) of two extremely laborious dissections. In neither
                  of these had I seen the <span style="font-style:italic">vasa efferentia chylifera</span> ; and being at the same time aware, that their existence, so far as I know, had been
                  merely presumed by preceding anatomists, but had not been distinctly demonstrated,
                  I felt disposed to think that there might be something in the anatomy of these animals,
                  not very well understood. Some of the arguments for and against the doctrine of absorption
                  of the chyle by veins I have stated in the letter immediately preceding this.</p>
               <p>The result of the inquiry into the lacteals of the porpoise being thus by no means
                  satisfactory to me, I availed myself of the first opportunity again of resuming it,
                  and of conducting the dissection, and injection of the lacteals, somewhat differently.
                  Having therefore obtained a third specimen of the porpoise, <a class="link_ref" href="#n08" title="The animal was about five feet in length and proved to be a pregnant female.">*</a>  my first care was to inject with quicksilver a considerable number of the lacteals
                  high on the mesentery, and nearest to the commencement of the thoracic duct; the whole
                  mass of the intestines was laid over to the left side, and that no impediment might
                  be offered to the course of the quicksilver, a circumstance I neglected in my former
                  dissections, I carefully dissected off the portion of the lower cava and aorta, which
                  lay immediately over the commencing roots of the thoracic duct. At this stage of the
                  dissection, I observed numerous vessels filled with chyle proceeding from the direction
                  of the mesenteric glands towards the thoracic duct, and terminating in it ; I felt
                  convinced that these vessels were the true <span style="font-style:italic">vasa efferentia</span>, but unwilling to rest a fact of so much importance on the bare inspection of vessels,
                  at all times deceptive in their appearance, I proceeded to fill about a dozen of the
                  lacteals (the <span style="font-style:italic">afferentia</span>) with quicksilver, after traversing the glands, flowed along the <span style="font-style:italic">vasa efferentia</span>, mixed with the chyle, and passed directly into the thoracic duct. The number of
                  the <span style="font-style:italic">vasa efferentia</span> so filled, might be about six, and the quantity of quicksilver conveyed by them into
                  the thoracic duct was such as to endanger its rupture. I next distended the thoracic
                  duct with air, and traced it to its entrance into the veins; the valves of this vessel
                  were as numerous as I have ever seen them, and the tunics of the duct were stronger
                  than I expected them to be.</p>
               <p>I ought further to mention, that the column of quicksilver used was not more than
                  nine or ten inches in depth ; yet such was the facility with which the metal traversed
                  the glands, and penetrated to the thoracic duct, that in order to secure the preparation,
                  and retain the fluid metal in the <span style="font-style:italic">vasa afferentia</span>, I was obliged to place a tight ligature immediately outside these glands; previous
                  to doing this, the vessels (the <span style="font-style:italic">vasa afferentia</span>) had been twice filled with quicksilver, which had as often disappeared. So many
                  of the <span style="font-style:italic">efferentia</span> (which are very numerous) had been cut, that I found it impracticable to arrange
                  the preparation in any other way. Moreover, I have no doubt that similar results may
                  at all times be commanded by a little care and patience on the part of the dissector,
                  and by attention to those circumstances which rendered my first dissections unsatisfactory.</p>
               <p>We cannot, I presume, now hesitate in affirming, that the anatomy of the seal and
                  of the porpoise do not furnish any argument against the long established doctrine
                  of the transmission of the chyle, the nutrient fluid of the body, to the general mass
                  of blood, by a peculiar system of vessels, consisting of one set of vessels which
                  convey the chyle to the mesenteric glands; and of another set of a precisely similar
                  structure, only somewhat larger, conveying the chyle more or less altered from the
                  glands to the thoracic duct, and thence into the veins; and it seems proved that there
                  is no other route by which the chyle passes into the blood, or at least that no necessity
                  arising out of peculiarity in structure has yet been shown in any animal, for its
                  adopting a different course. The facility with which the metal reached the <span style="font-style:italic">vasa efferentia</span>, makes it probable that a structure similar to what exists in the whale, as described
                  by Mr Abernethy, will also be found in the porpoise ; that is, that certain lacteals
                  pass directly through the glands, maintaining a comparatively large calibre throughout
                  ; but I mention this merely as a conjecture. It will afford me much pleasure, should
                  the result of this inquiry meet with your approbation.</p>

            two surviving children of seven (Bates 110).</div>
         <div class="note" id="n11"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>The lacteal system essentially refers to what is now understood as the lymphatic system.
            The lymphatic system “consists of an extensive network of vessels deputed to the drainage
            of extravasated fluids. The contractility of lymphatic vessels and the presence of
            valves are essential for the generation and regulation of the lymph transport.” In
            simpler terms, the lymphatic system is more or less an essential part of the immune
            system. It is in need of much further study, especially with regard to clinical oncology.
            Prior to modern definitions, the lymphatic system was called by the name “lacteal”
            because of its easily identifiable “milk-like content”, which refers to chyle. The
            17th century was considered the golden age of research into the lymphatic system in
            the Western world (Natale et al. 417).</div>
         <div class="note" id="n12"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Here, Knox is referring to a famous German anatomist (received his M.D.) known for
            his landmark contributions to a variety of fields: zoology, embryology, morphology,
            and many more. He was especially known for his comprehensive work on fetal brain development,
            and his inarguable evidence proving that a fetus has a closed circulatory system separate
            from the mother’s ("Tiedemann, Friedrich"). </div>
         <div class="note" id="n13"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>The person referred to here is likely Vincenz Fohmann, another German anatomist most
            known for his masterful injections of mercury into the smallest lymphatic vessels,
            preserved to this day in museums of Heidelberg and Liège (Natale et al. 425-6).</div>
         <div class="note" id="n14"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Knox will go on to specify that the fatal error he has perceived in Tiedemann’s conceptualization
            and/or dissection of the lymphatic system is “absorption by means of veins.” My understanding
            is that he aims to complicate this perception by way of proving absorption via blood
            vessels rather than veins. Tiedemann had long been known for his interest in “the
            absorption of nutrients from the alimentary tract” in relation to lymphatic vessels
            by 1820, and it would later inform his work on the spleen. (At the time, little was
            known about the function and/or importance of the spleen, and its integration into
            the lymphatic system in the process of blood formation--so this was a sign of enormous
            progress). So in truth it seems that Knox either may be under a misapprehension, or
            is pointing out some small adjustment in the processes outlined by Tiedemann. ("Tiedemann,
            Friedrich"). </div>
         <div class="note" id="n15"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>This is unfortunately not the first case (nor the last) in which Knox would denigrate
            the work of his fellow colleagues with immediate and unabating fervor, insisting on
            the superiority of his own work by comparison. Biographical evidence confirms this
            propensity, in that an American naturalist named John James Audubon visited Edinburgh
            in 1826 and was welcomed with unerring consideration and support from Knox. However,
            the moment Audubon asked his fellow scientists to evaluate the work he’d done, Knox
            (along with his colleagues) became acerbic and harsh, degrading everything he’d accomplished
            all of a sudden. Audubon would note his mixed feelings and disappointment about the
            encounter in his own writings (Rosner 95-6).</div>
         <div class="note" id="n16"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>This is an ambitious statement, and in all likelihood untrue. William Hunter won the
            Copley medal in 1769 for his astounding strides in knowledge of the lymphatic system.
            He observed, much like Knox, that “lymphatics and lacteals were two different features
            contributing to the formation of the same network of vessels endowed with absorbent
            function. He noted that a dye injected into the arteries fills the veins but never
            enters the lymphatic vessels, unless the arterial wall is damaged…unlike veins, lymphatics
            are not continuous with arteries” (Natale et al. 423). Although their approaches were
            different, both understood the movement of lymphatic fluid via capillaries. If there
            is any observation of distinction here, it is likely more minute than he makes it
            out to be.</div>
         <div class="note" id="n17"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>This will become evident towards the end of this letter-turned-journal article, but
            essentially Knox here is speaking to the discovery of blood vessels and how they transmit
            human blood throughout the body, rather than veins. The smallest kind of blood vessels
            in the human body are known as capillaries, which vitally connect arteries to veins.
            In the lymphatic system specifically, “lymphatic capillaries tend to be larger in
            diameter than blood capillaries and are interspersed among them to enhance their ability
            to collect interstitial fluid efficiently. They are critical in the drainage of extracellular
            fluid and allow this fluid to enter the closed capillaries but not exit due to their
            unique morphology. Special lymphatic capillaries called lacteals exist in the small
            intestine to contribute to the absorption of dietary fats” (Null et al.). While it
            is unclear if Knox’s discovery was truly as groundbreaking as he proclaims it to be
            (capillaries were discovered long before 1824 in 1661 by Marcello Malpighi (Pearce)),
            there was at least basic merit to sharing this observation with the larger scientific
            community (Natale et al. 418). More microscopic aspects of medicine were still in
            the process of being discovered and described in detail at the time, and this process
            is continuing with regard to the lymphatic system even now.</div>
         <div class="note" id="n18"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>There is something to be said here for Knox’s insistence upon proving Tiedemann wrong,
            rather than establishing a new discovery and writing in dialogue with other anatomists,
            which appears to be more common practice. The rhetoric and focal point of his argument
            (toward only his own merit) suggests the kind of myopia that would fuel his denial
            of any negligence in the Burke and Hare murder trials. Furthermore, there is the reality
            that his work is built on much of existing anatomical expertise, a footnote in a much
            larger accomplishment.</div>
         <div class="note" id="n19"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Burke said in his official confession that “Knox was present on two occasions when
            Burke and Hare delivered murdered bodies, and that in one case he had approved of
            a corpse’s freshness, but asked no questions” (Richardson 135). While one can understand
            the necessity of keeping organic material intact for the sake of an unmarred dissection,
            the implications of two men bringing him a “freshly” deceased body with consistent
            immediacy should have been an obvious indication that something was amiss based solely
            on temporal logistics. Christison aptly observed as much in his recollection of Knox’s
            boasts about receiving a dozen or so bodies in such pristine condition, with the incriminating
            revelation that “[Knox] had made very light of this suggestion” when Christison remarked
            that the corpses likely had never been buried (and then stolen) at all based on their
            condition (Richardson 141).</div>
         <div class="note" id="n20"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Again, he obsesses over the quality of his dissection tools with perhaps more frequency
            than would be deemed appropriate or necessary; certainly the tools at hand do have
            some bearing on the quality of one’s work, but this is common knowledge and common
            practice. </div>
         <div class="note" id="n21"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Formerly mentioned in my explanatory essay above, this practice of preserving organic
            material “in spirits” (usually meant alcohol) was not limited to mere animal specimens.
            Mary Paterson’s body was subjected to the same preservation, but with a much more
            perverse intent. Here one can see the beginnings of where Knox’s ardor likely extended
            too far; what was once for strictly scientific purposes merged into the realm of misogynistic
            objectification. While anatomists and doctors may not all engage in this confusion
            of priority or intent, it is clear that the working class had ample reason to suspect
            the intentions of certain anatomists and doctors. No one person is immune to such
            biases or misconduct.</div>
         <div class="note" id="n22"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Quicksilver is liquid mercury, often used in a variety of scientific endeavors. Naturally
            as a result of the toxicity of mercury vaporization at room temperature, this substance
            is no longer commonly used in this kind of research, and when it is, the utmost precautions
            are taken. The silver substance was used in anatomical experiments in order to reveal
            the movement of certain body fluids throughout the body, as the silver coloring and
            permeation was easily visible to the naked eye.</div>
         <div class="note" id="n23"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Part of why liquid mercury was so effective in tracing the lymphatic system in particular
            is the fact that “lymphatic vessels…form a largely invisible, delicate and intricate
            network…[it seemed] more indefinite, elusive and mysterious” (Natale et al. 418).
            While lacteals have a white liquid (chyle) inside that render them more visible in
            the body, lymphatic vessels elsewhere “contain[ed] a clear water fluid that render[ed]
            them nearby invisible and their presence was very difficult to be documented” (Natale
            et al. 423).</div>
         <div class="note" id="n24"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>To Knox’s credit, part of why anatomical investigations into the lymphatic system
            were so few was due to the exceptional technical difficulty of such procedures necessitating
            liquid mercury injections for a meaningful dissection. British surgeon John Sheldon
            explained in 1784 that “the difficulty of dissection is increased, from the necessity
            of injecting with quicksilver: for if we happen to wound the vessels, our labor will
            be lost by the escape of that subtile fluid” (Natale et al. 423).</div>
         <div class="note" id="n25"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>John Abernethy was a well-known surgeon from this period, born in London and primarily
            working at St. Bartholomew’s hospital. He was best known for his skill as an anatomy
            instructor; he was so sought after that the hospital eventually had to build a lecture
            theater to accommodate the endless stream of his incoming students (Jacyna). Both
            Knox and Christison studied under him, which may explain the uncharacteristic deference
            with which Knox refers to Abernethy.</div>

            match I could find was a journal article titled “Some Particulars in the Anatomy of
            a Whale” from the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London in 1796.
            Knox’s description also aligns with the contents of this article, suggesting the veracity
            of this identification (Home and Abernethy 27-9).</div>
